Main reasons for cyber attacks. 2.3.1. Causes Arising from Existing System Errors The main reason for the rapid increase in cyberattacks is the structure of computer systems and communication networks. The vulnerabilities, de\\ufb01ciencies, and miscon\\ufb01gu- rations in hardware, software, and computer networks expose the systems to attacks that\\n\\ndollars annually across the globe. In addition, new devices such as smartphones and IoT devices have increased attack surfaces. Cyber criminals constantly elaborate on existing cyber attacks by generating different versions and using new attack variants for smartphones and IoT devices. Recent studies have shown that fake applications, backdoors, and banking Trojans are rising for mobile devices [ 34]. Furthermore, cyber attacks related to social media, IoT devices, cryptocurrency, and the cloud computing environment are also increasing.\\n\\nThis process, called forwarding, is covered in the data plane. Additionally, a router can block the forwarded packets if they are malicious or duplicated. Routing is the determined route or path that packets \\ufb02ow in from a sender to a receiver. The controller plane determines a path using a routing algorithm between the sender and receiver (for example, from Host-A to Host-B in Figure 7). There are two routing structures in the controller plane: static and dynamic routing. While static routing works better in small networks, dynamic routing will be more effective for many networks. In the Software- De\\ufb01ned Network (SDN) paradigm, the forwarding and routing system differs from the classical system [ 154]. In SDN, the controller layer is moved from the underlying network to a logically centralized controller responsible for \\ufb01nding a path and installing routing\\n\\nMan-in-the-Middle Attack Definition\\nA man-in-the-middle \\u0000MITM\\u0000 attack is a\\u00a0form of cyberattack\\u00a0in which criminals exploiting\\nweak web-based protocols insert themselves between entities in a communication channel\\nto steal data.\\u00a0\\nNone of the parties sending email, texting, or chatting on a video call are aware that an\\nattacker has inserted their presence into the conversation and that the attacker is stealing\\ntheir data.\\u00a0\\nWhile most cyberattacks are silent and carried out without the victims' knowledge, some\\nMITM attacks are the opposite.
